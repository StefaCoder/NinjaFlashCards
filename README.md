# NinjaFlashCards
My team and I developed a functional web application to help users create decks, cards, and begin study sessions to learn different subjects. Developed in Java using the Spring MVC framework connected to a Postgres database. Front-end implementation in JavaScript (Vue.js), HTML, and CSS.
